        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by 
        Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break 
        down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 
        short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word 
        for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as 
        a university student." />
